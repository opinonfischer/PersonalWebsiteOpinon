Presentation Title: Cyber-Physical Digital Twins – Georgia Tech Smart Campus Cases Studies
abstract: "Digital Engineering, in its very essence, is concerned with advancements in computing, modeling, data management and analytical capabilities to improve the practice of engineering.  Key to Digital Engineering is the concept of Digital Twin.  While initially developed for engineering systems, Digital Twins are now being implemented for socio-cyber-physical systems (e.g. smart buildings, smart cities, etc.) due to their ability to leverage the benefits of digital technologies to non-digital systems. In their presentation, Dr. Olivia Fischer and Dr. Scott Duncan will first present a multi-scale, integrated environment that supports situational awareness, optimization, as well as forecasting and virtual experimentation at the Georgia Tech campus level. They will then discuss recent efforts in developing a Digital Twin of GT’s Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design (KBISD). The use of the Digital Twin made it possible for KBISD to receive certification in 2021 as a “Living Building” from the International Living Futures Institute (ILFI). Finally, they will address the shortcomings of current approaches to the development of Digital Twins and introduce ongoing efforts towards the definition and implementation of a model-based approach to the definition and development of Institutional Management Digital Twins which leverages architectural and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) practices and principles."
